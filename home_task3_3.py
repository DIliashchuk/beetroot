#Make a program with 2 numbers saved in separate variables a and b,
# then print the result for each of the following:

firstNumber = 10
secondNumber = 8
print(firstNumber + secondNumber)
print(firstNumber - secondNumber)
print(firstNumber / secondNumber)
print(firstNumber * secondNumber)
print(firstNumber ** secondNumber)
print(firstNumber % secondNumber)
print(firstNumber // secondNumber)
