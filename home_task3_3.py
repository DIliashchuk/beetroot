#Make a program with 2 numbers saved in separate variables a and b,
# then print the result for each of the following:

first_number = 10
second_number = 8
print(first_numberNumber + second_number)
print(first_number - second_number)
print(first_number / second_number)
print(first_number * second_number)
print(first_number ** second_number)
print(first_number % second_number)
print(first_number // second_number)
